This is an extension of a class project for Online Markets, a class I took in Spring of 2022 that focused on Auction Theory, Online Learning Algorithms (Reinforcement Learning Algorithms), and Online Markets (from a theoretical perspective). In one of our weekly projects I created a novel algorithm that produced promising results, but I didn't have the time to properly analyze it.

The folder labeled "Class_Work" shows what I completed in about a week during class time. The folder labeled "New_Work" shows my new work.
